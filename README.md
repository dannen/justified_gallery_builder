justified_gallery_builder
=========================

A perl script to build an index.html file for CLI use of Justified Gallery.

usage:

cd path_to_build_index_in
~/justified_gallery_builder.pl

Justified_gallery_builder is a simple, non-object-oriented script to build a basic index.html file that conforms properly to the Justified Gallery ( http://miromannino.com/projects/justified-gallery/ ) code.  It is intended to quickly mock-up a gallery inside a directory of image files.

For better results, I suggest you use my other scripts on the directory prior to executing justified_gallery_builder.
