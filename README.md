justified_gallery_builder
=========================

A perl script to build an index.html file for CLI use of Justified Gallery.

usage:

cd path_to_build_index_in
~/justified_gallery_builder.pl

requirements: 

justified_resize:
https://github.com/dannen/justified_resize/

Justfied Gallery:
http://miromannino.com/projects/justified-gallery/


Justified_gallery_builder is a simple, non-object-oriented script to build a basic index.html file that conforms properly to the Justified Gallery ( http://miromannino.com/projects/justified-gallery/ ) code.  It is intended to quickly mock-up a gallery inside a directory of image files.


For better results, I suggest you use my all_mtime script on the  image directory prior to executing justified_gallery_builder.
